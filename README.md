# Automated_TikTok_Videos

A Python program that automatically creates TikTok-format videos from different subreddits.
For examples, you can check this Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/cool_reddit_things/reels/. I posted a video per day for about two months. Some of them got some success, like about 180k views for the best ones.
This project uses web scraping to get info from Reddit pages. So you will need to change the user ID and login in the file if you want to try it. It uses MoviePy to edit the video with subtitles or images and Tortoise to create the voiceover.
I stopped working on it in December 2023. So, with the pace of AI growth, this means Tortoise is either way better with new functionalities not used, or there are better free alternatives which I am not aware of.
