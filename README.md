# Automated_TikTok_Videos

A Python program that automatically creates TikTok-format videos from different subreddits.
For examples, you can check this Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/cool_reddit_things/reels/. I posted a video per day for about two months. Some of them got some success, like about 180k views for the best ones.
This project uses web scraping and the reddit API to get info from Reddit pages. So you will need to change the user ID and login for both ,your redit account and reddit api keys,in the file if you want to try it. It uses MoviePy to edit the video with subtitles or images and Tortoise to create the voiceover.
I stopped working on it in December 2023. So, with the pace of AI growth, this means Tortoise is either way better with new functionalities not used, or there are better free alternatives which I am not aware of.
You will also need a video for the background of the video. Either by importing it wich can take quit a while if this is a big file. Or just import the video on your drive and then connect the drive to collab.

There are some issues/upgrades possible worth mentioning. When using the voiceover some abreviation a red wrong wich can be annoying. The text font is not really good. Maybe there are better voices... And others things linked to how the final video will be and how polished or not it will be.
